# Overview {.unnumbered}

This page is an exploration of how fecal indicator bacteria in the Tampa Bay watershed are influenced by hydrologic inputs. The primary audience is technical staff at TBEP so this information can be used in the development of bay-wide report cards. Because this is a very exploratory project meant primarily for internal use, but made public because open science and general transparency are important, the writing is more like a series of blog posts than a fully polished report.  

Unless otherwise noted, all data used are from estuarine stations.
